* base-action branch
** HOOK INTO ~display-buffer-base-action~ INSTEAD OF ~display-buffer-overriding-action~
   MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR!!! This is a major change in implementation details. It is
   inteded to simplify the configuration of display rules by using the original
   ~display-buffer-alist~, which isn't shadowed by Purpose anymore.
** get rid a ~purpose-display-fallback~
   No longer necessary, use regular ~display-buffer~ fallback mechanism via
   ~display-buffer-fallback-action~
** ~purpose-special-action-sequences~ is deprecated and replaced by ~display-buffer-alist~
   Example of configuration migration:
   
   Old:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (push '(Neotree purpose-display-reuse-window-buffer
           purpose-display-reuse-window-purpose
           purpose--fix-display-neotree)
         purpose-special-action-sequences)
   #+END_SRC

   New:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (push '((lambda (buffer)
             (eq (purpose-buffer-purpose buffer) 'Neotree))
           (purpose-display-reuse-window-buffer
            purpose-display-reuse-window-purpose
            purpose--fix-display-neotree))
         display-buffer-alist)
   #+END_SRC
